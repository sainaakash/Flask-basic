"""
it is a web application written in python, used to create end to end projects
developed by armin ronacher in 2010
it is based on WSGI(web server gateway interface) toolkit and jinja2 template engine

WSGI: it is a standard / protocol
if we have setup a web server and it is connected to a web application meaning it web
Then if someone is requesting the web server to access the web application, these requests are http requests.
So when the requests comes to the web server, so from the web server there will be a need of some kind of a standard or a protocol
in order to communicate with the web application and this kind of communication we use 'WSGI'. 


Jinja2: it is a web templating system
it combines a web template along with a certain data source, the data source dynamically integrate and renders dynamic pages. 
these dynamic pages means,
in a ML application for classification whether an image is god or cat
so when an image is uploaded on the application and request is made the result will come from ML model which is the data source in this case. 
this data source can be anything an ML model or a SQL database
